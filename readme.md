## Summary
This document is as a comprehensive README for the Airtrack API project, a command line interface (CLI) application designed to help aiports manage their airplanes properly to make sure that no accidents happen on the run way such as colliding with other planes. It would be an application used by workers at an airport controlling the air space.

## Project Overview

Made in intellij, AirTrack API is a command line interface (CLI) project that lets aiports keep track of where airplanes are landing and if they are near and other airports to avoid accidents. Airports using this application will have a safe way to manage aiplanes and make sure they land correctly. Additonally, we keep data of passengers and what planes they are on/have been on.

### Features
- **Keep Track Of Passengers**: You can view all passengers on a plane with unique identifiers
- **Passengers Boarding Planes**: You can view all passengers boarded on a plane.
- **Plane Management**: You can manage all of the plane data and check if its at an airport.
- **Airport Management**: You can view all Airports and see what planes are based there.
- **Connect Airports to Planes**: When working with Airports a plane will need to be connected to the new airport it will land at.

### Installation and Use
To set up the AirTrack API project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Postgres downloaded to create the tables used in the schema.sql file into your own database. Keep in mind that this was made using the intellij software text editor.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the github repository (folder) to your local machine. Then open the folder in your text editor and run it.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fake4091/Spring-Unit-Project/tree/main
